# Dry Shower
The Dry Shower Project is an interactive exhibition device built with an ESP32 microcontroller that simulates the collection of rainwater and a "dry shower" experience. It uses vibration, lights and sound to mimic the sensation of showering with limited water, inspired by varying rainfall levels in three different countries. The device features ~~a potentiometer~~ a button for country selection, a ~~switch~~ button to activate the shower mode, a vibration motor for tactile feedback, an LED strip to simulate the current remaining water level, an LED on the shower head to visualize water coming out, and a speaker for ambient sounds (rainfall, showering).

# 2025W-Water-Challenge
Water is at the center of some of today’s most urgent global challenges.
From biodiversity loss in river systems and hidden pollutants in drinking water,
to water footprints, floods, and droughts driven by climate change,
these issues increasingly shape our environment and daily lives.
 
The student exhibition explores water challenges through tangible artifacts and interactive design projects. By transforming complex and often invisible water-related issues into physical, experiential works, students invite the public to see, touch, and reflect on the realities of water today.
 
Through creativity, critical thinking, and hands-on design, we encourage new perspectives on our relationship with water from now and in the years to come.
